# Cartesian Categories as Markov Categories

This file shows that cartesian monoidal categories (categories with finite products)
are Markov categories where every morphism is deterministic.

## Mathematical significance

Cartesian categories represent deterministic computation, e.g., the "classical" world where
functions have unique outputs and information can be freely duplicated. By showing these
form Markov categories, we see that:

1. Markov categories generalize from deterministic to probabilistic settings
2. The axioms of Markov categories, when specialized to the deterministic case,
   recover the structure of products
3. Probabilistic and deterministic computation share the same compositional structure

In a cartesian setting, copying is the diagonal morphism
`Œî : X ‚Üí X √ó X` (which duplicates data) and deletion is the unique morphism
to the terminal object (which discards data). There is no probabilistic
branching. Every morphism preserves the copy operation perfectly.

## Main definitions

* `diagonalCopy` - The diagonal morphism as copy operation
* `terminalDelete` - The unique morphism to terminal as delete operation

## Main results

* `instMarkovCategoryOfCartesian` - Cartesian monoidal categories are Markov categories
* `deterministic_of_cartesian` - Every morphism in a cartesian category is deterministic
* `copy_eq_diagonal` - The copy operation equals the diagonal
* `del_eq_terminal` - The delete operation equals the terminal morphism

## Implementation notes

We use the existing `CartesianMonoidalCategory` structure which provides
the monoidal structure from finite products. The braiding is constructed from
the product projections and pairing: `swap(x,y) = (y,x)` using `‚ü®snd, fst‚ü©`.

The proofs are straightforward because products naturally satisfy the comonoid
axioms; this is the "canonical comonoid" that exists in any cartesian category.
The use of `ext` (extensionality for products) reduces most proofs to the
universal property of products.

## Design rationale

We define this as an instance rather than just a theorem because:
1. It allows cartesian categories to automatically inherit all Markov category theory
2. It provides the canonical test case; any construction or theorem in Markov
   category theory MUST reduce to the correct classical result when specialized to
   cartesian categories. If it doesn't, the construction is wrong.
3. It validates the framework: Shows that Markov categories generalize
   classical categories by including them as the "zero randomness" special case

/-- In a cartesian monoidal category, the diagonal provides the copy operation.

This is `‚ü®id, id‚ü© : X ‚Üí X √ó X`, which duplicates the value.
In the category of sets/types, this sends `x ‚Ü¶ (x, x)`. -/

This discards information; there's no way to recover X from the terminal object.
